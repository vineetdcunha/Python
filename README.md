# python
Data analysis and python programming

Data_analysis - Data analysis, preprocessing and cleaning.

User_Input_IQ - Responds to the user using all three inputs above to output a message predicting their grade.

Overlapping_Squares - Accepts inputs from the user and computes the area of the overlap between the two squares.

Happy_Prime - Returns true if an int is a happy prime and computes and prints the first 100 happy and sad prime numbers.

Stem_Leaf_Plot - Accepts the input, reads in the appropriate datafile and displays a stem and leaf plot.

Avocados_Stats - Calculates the mean, median and standard deviation without using in built python libraries.

Game - The user begins with an account value of $100. She may place a bet of an amount of her choosing, but not more than her current balance. She then rolls two six-sided dice. Her score is the sum of the faces of the dice. If she rolls a 7 or a 12 she wins and doubles her bet. If she does not roll a 7 or 12, she has the option to double her bet and roll a third die. If all three dice sum to 7 or 12 she wins three times the total value of her bet.

# Ellipse
Ellipse_Area_Circumference - Capture the necessary information of an ellipse and return the area and circumference

Ellipse_Area_Circumference_rotated - Capture the necessary information of a rotated ellipse and return the area and circumference

Ellipse_Monte_Carlo_Overlap - Using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the overlapping area of an ellipse.

Ellipse_Monte_Carlo_Overlap_rotated - Using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the overlapping area of a rotated ellipse.

Ellipse_UT - Automated running all the relevant cases for testing ellipse functions

Ellipse_UT_rotated - Automated running all the relevant cases for testing rotated ellipse functions
